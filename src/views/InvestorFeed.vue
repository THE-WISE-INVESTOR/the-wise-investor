        Once you become an entrepreneur, itâ€™s easy to get sucked into the eye of
        the storm and get entrapped by a mindset that is focused purely on
        keeping the business afloat and running. But a bit of introspection
        would often allow the founders of these businesses to realize that
        things could have been done differently- or not done at all.

        Productive people have one thing in common: a solid routine consisting

        into their routine. Research has shown that a habit takes approximately
        21 days to become normal behavior. So, here are some habits you can
